## Description

this project is a data platform that extracts data from an operational database and makes it available in a OLAP data warehouse.

The platform grabs data from a database simulating the backend of a commercial application, then cleans and arranges the data according to a [star schema](https://dbdiagram.io/d/RevisedDW-63a19c5399cb1f3b55a27eca) designed for analytics. Finally the remodelled data is used to update another database. 

This process is done automatically on any new data being detected.
